            <h2>Web Usability</h2>

            <p>
              1. <b>Attention</b>: My web application uses space and paragragh
              to separate information. Each paragragh contains different aspect
              of web usability, so it helps users to keep attention.
            </p>

            <p>
              2. <b>Font Typeface</b>: Font typeface is an important aspect of
              enhancing web usability. A good typeface could make the user feel
              comfortable to read the information without feeling tired or
              uncomfortable. I used the typeface from Bootstrap, and I think my
              font typeface is very clear for reading.
            </p>

            <p>
              3. <b>Fitt’s Law</b>: The web application should follow Fitt’s Law
              that make sure the buttons are big enough for the users to click.
              I appilied this theory on my website and made the search box, the
              drop-down list and the buttons big enought so that the users can
              easily aim on them.
            </p>

            <p>
              4. <b>Easy to memorize</b>: The web application should not be very
              complex that forces the users to learn and memorize and recall the
              process of using the website. The website should uses simple
              structure that makes the users easily to use without spending time
              to learn it. My website has a simple structure. And the users can
              clearly see and understand what information is presented without
              memorize and recall the process of using my website.
            </p>

            <p>
              5. <b>Font Size</b>: Font size is important too. A small font size
              would be difficult to read and would make the users feel tired
              quickly. And a too larg font size will cause the user to scroll
              more often. So, to improve web usability, we need to choose a
              proper font size. On my website, I think I am using proper font
              size that big enough to read easily.
            </p>

            <p>
              6. <b>Contrast</b>: Contrast makes the text distinguish from the
              background. A strong Contrast could make the users read the text
              easily. I used black and white contrast colors on my website. So
              my content is clearly displayed and easy to read.
            </p>
            <p>
              7. <b>Convinience</b>: A good website should avoid to force users
              to do complex actions. The website should make the users to easily
              redirect and move between different pages. On my website, I put a
              Navigation bar on the home page. It has a drop-down list to
              navigate the users between my assignments and labs.And on my
              assignment and lab pages, I also put a Navigation bar that allows
              the users to easily switch between them or go back to the home
              page.
            </p>

            <p>
              8. <b>Optimize for mobile devices</b>: A good website should work
              properly on different PCs and mobile devices without breaking the
              layout. My website uses toggler nav bars from Bootstrap that could
              changes layout automatically on mobile devices and ajusts to
              different screen size.
            </p>

            <p>
              9. <b>Consistency</b>: A good website should have consistency so
              that the same components always works the same way, so the users
              do not need to learn it every time. My website has consistency. It
              uses similar nav bars on home page and lab pages. It has same
              structure and the buttons works in the same way. So, as long as
              the user used 1 page of my website, they are capable to use other
              pages without learn anything new.
            </p>
            <p>
              10.<b>Accessibility</b>: A good website should have accessibility.
              It should support the people with disibility. For example, the
              website should has readable attributes so that the blind people
              can also use it via voice. And the website should avoid using
              color blind colors to distinguish components so that the color
              blind people can use it without difficuties.
            </p>

            <p>
              11. <b>Graphics</b>: Graphics and videos could enhance the user's
              experience and appeal users in many cases. A good graohical design
              can make the website stands out and appeal the users to stay.
              Currently, my website does not have graphics, but I am working on
              adding more multimedia conponents including graphics and videos in
              future updates.
